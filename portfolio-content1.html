    <p><strong>HTML/CSS - Portfolio Site</strong><br><br>For my first project at Mayden Academy, I created this
        portfolio site using HTML and CSS. The brief was to create a site to showcase our work, using a home
        page, about page, contact page and portfolio page, and test it across browsers, including IE 9. I really
        enjoyed designing the site and making it scalable, and really started to get to grips with using HTML
        and CSS.</p>

    <p><strong>PHP - Blog Engine</strong><br><br>For my second project at Mayden Academy, I built a blog engine
        for my website, using PHP and SQL. The brief was to create a blog page on our sites showing links to all
        the articles, create an article page with a friendly URL structure and show the 3 latest blog posts
        somewhere on our site. Our PHP had to be functional and unit tested, and we also had to
        use git to branch off of our previous master version of the site and commit changes.<br>After
        creating pull requests, we code reviewed other members of the group. I chose to use a MySQL
        database to enable me to easily create new blog entries and efficiently query the data in PHP. I
        really enjoyed getting to put what we had learnt of PHP basics into practice and combining it with
        HTML and CSS to create the foundations of a dynamic site. It was also a great introduction to using
        git and working well as a scrum team, by keeping up with code reviews for each person/story.</p>

    <p><strong>PHP - Fence Calculator</strong><br><br>As an additional challenge during our PHP basics module,
        we had to create a PHP application that could calculate the amount of posts and railings required to
        build a fence of a certain length or calculate the length of a fence when provided with the amount of
        posts and railings. It had to have a basic user interface for specifying amount of posts and railings
        and the length of the fence, but the front end had to be minimal, with no CSS and as little HTML as
        possible. Each fence had to start and end with a post and contain at least 1 railing. When
        calculating the amount of posts and railings needed to cover a certain length fence, the result
        had to span at least the length required, no less, and the fence length results had to be displayed
        in metres with no more than 2 decimal places. It also had to be unit tested and use functions.<br>This
        was a great challenge and really helped me to feel confident using functions in PHP. I created two
        separate functions (one to calculate the fence length if provided with number of posts and railings,
        and one to calculate the number of posts/railings when provided with the fence length) and a simple
        form in HTML. The correct function was called depending on which options the user chose.</p>
