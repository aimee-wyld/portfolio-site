    <p><strong>JavaScript/jQuery - Christmas Game</strong><br><br>For our JavaScript and jQuery module, our academy
        group worked as a team to build a Christmas-themed game. The requirements were for a player to be able to
        register their details on a splash page, play the game and be able to see high scores using a leader board
        page.<br>The game consists of a player-controlled snowman icon which has to navigate a moving map of obstacles,
        coming from the right of the screen and moving out to the left. The user can move the icon up or down to
        avoid these obstacles and the game runs indefinitely with a timer visible to the user until they collide
        with one of the obstacles.<br>We used git and split out each story into a new branch so that we could all work
        on various parts of the game at once. I mainly focused on the animation of the obstacles with another member
        of the group; it ended up being quite a complex task due to needing two animations - one to load the first
        level and move it across the screen, and another to move that level off the screen and remove it from play -
        this way we could have levels constantly moving across the screen with no gap. The level loading had to be
        random and increase in speed/difficulty, which was also a fun challenge. Making this game was really
        enjoyable - we worked really well as a team and I'm really proud of the finished product!

    <p><strong>JavaScript and jQuery - Form Validator</strong><br><br>During the same week that we built the game,
    we were given a challenge to complete at home: building validation into an HTML form using JavaScript/jQuery.
    I used a click event on the submit button to check the specified fields before allowing the data to be submitted.
    Splitting up each type of requirement into a function was great practice at using DRY code.</p>

    <p><strong>Home Project - Dinosaur Game</strong><br><br>Having really enjoyed playing with JS during
    our teaching week, I decided to try and build a simple game at home over the weekend. The user can steer their
    icon using the arrow buttons, growing each time they collide with/eat a piece of broccoli. When the player icon
    grows too large for the screen, the game ends, and the user is given a count of how much broccoli was consumed.<br>
    Although simple, I really enjoyed building this game in my spare time, and plan to add in a countdown timer so
    that the user needs to eat as much broccoli as they can before the timer runs out (at the moment the growth of
    the user icon doesn't change, so it needs adjusting to make the outcome of the game different each time!)</p>
