    <p><strong>Advanced Front End - Carousel</strong><br><br>Another challenge was to build a sliding carousel with
        next/previous user controls. It had to be fully responsive, scaling with the browser, slide from image to
        image and loop continuously. It also had to use a preprocessor, and we were not allowed to use plugins.<br> It
        was really good practice at using a preprocessor; I used Less and found the ability to use variables and mixins
        very useful. I also enjoyed having more practice using animations and getting it to be fully responsive was
        very satisfying.

    <p><strong>Home Project - Art Site</strong><br><br>Before joining the academy, I created a website for my art
    using tumblr. Although nice to be able to put some of my work online, it was extremely simple and very limited
        in terms of layout, so having learned enough HTML/CSS/PHP/JS to be able to build other projects, I thought
        it might be time to completely revamp my page and make it look exactly as I had envisioned.<br>To try and
    practice a bit of everything, I decided to store my image paths in a database, so it's really easy to add extra
    images to the page. I'm also trying to make it as responsive as possible, and load different content using
    AJAX.<br>It's not quite finished yet, but I'm really happy with how it's coming on and it's nice to be able to
    work on a personal project whilst using all the recent skills that I've learned. I have removed the link whilst
    I'm finishing it off.</p>

    <p><strong>Full Stack - Space Book</strong><br><br>Having started to learn some more advanced PHP, our project during
    this module was to build a parking space booking system. The premise was that a company had 3 car parks: one for
        visitors and two for staff. Employees needed to be able to book parking spaces in the staff car parks, for a
        minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 1 year. The visitors car park could be booked for a minimum of 1 hour and a
        maximum of 1 day. Employees could not book more than 1 space in the staff car park at any one time and could
        book a maximum of 5 spaces in the visitors car park. Employees could make a special request to HR for additional
        spaces.<br>As a team, we split the project up into stories and then individual tasks. I designed the site with
        another member of the team and we went on to build the front-end using bootstrap and Sass. I then worked on
        calculating the available spaces with another member of the team using PHP and SQL, which ended up being fairly
        complicated, due to all of the different circumstances - the problem-solving aspect of this project was really
        fun.<br> We tried to use classes where we could to put into practice our recent introduction to OOP, and unit
        tested all of our functions.</p>
