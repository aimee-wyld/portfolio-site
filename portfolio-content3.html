    <p><strong>Advanced Front End - Carousel</strong><br><br>Another challenge was to build a sliding carousel with
        next/previous user controls. It had to be fully responsive, scaling with the browser, slide from image to
        image and loop continuously. It also had to use a preprocessor, and we were not allowed to use plugins.<br> It
        was really good practice to use a preprocessor; I used Less and found the ability to use variables and mixins
        very useful. I also enjoyed having more practice using animations and getting it to be fully responsive was
        very satisfying.

    <p><strong>Home Project - Art Site</strong><br><br>Before joining the academy, I created a website for my art
    using tumblr. Although nice to be able to put some of my work online, it was extremely simple and very limited
        in terms of layout, so having learned enough HTML/CSS/PHP/JS to be able to build other projects, I thought
        it might be time to completely revamp my page and make it look exactly as I had envisioned.<br>To try and
    practice a bit of everything, I decided to store my image paths in a database, so it's really easy to add extra
    images to the page. I'm also trying to make it as responsive as possible, and load different content using
    AJAX.<br>It's not quite finished yet, but I'm really happy with how it's coming on and it's nice to be able to
    work on a personal project whilst using all the recent skills that I've learned.</p>
