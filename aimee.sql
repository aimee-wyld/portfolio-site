	(1,'HTML, CSS and Dinosaurs','dinosaurs-blog','Hi, we\'re Jess and Aim&eacute;e. Now that we\'re a few weeks into the Mayden Academy training programme, we thought we\'d share a taster of what we\'ve learned so far. But first, here\'s a little about each of us:<br><br>\nI\'m Jess - I studied Mathematics at University in Liverpool and knew after taking a coding module in the first year that I wanted to be a software developer. I love music, Japanese culture and bearded dragons!<br><br>\nAnd I\'m Aim&eacute;e - I\'m an English graduate but started studying computing part-time this year, after becoming more and more fascinated by technology. I love all things sci-fi and fantasy, drawing, painting and weird and wonderful music...<br><br>\nSo, let\'s talk about HTML, CSS and dinosaurs. We\'ve been learning about how different HTML elements (dinosaurs) display on a webpage - to help us to choose the right elements when we build. <br><br>\n<strong>Block vs Inline</strong><br>\nFor the most part, there are two default types of dinosaurs: block and inline. Some examples of block dinosaurs are the (div)lodocus, the (p)-rex and the (header)dactyl.<br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/diplo.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"25%\"><br>\nBlock dinosaurs like to be alone, so by default, they will stretch as wide as they possibly can to take up all available space.<br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/diplo.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"90%\"><br>\nYou can change how much space a block dinosaur takes up by altering its width, height, margins and padding: <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"40%\"><br><br>\nBut, sadly, even if you force them to take up less space, block dinosaurs will still refuse to sit next to any other dinosaurs:<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/noooo.png\" alt=\"diplodocus and pterodactyl\" width=\"50%\"><br><br>\nOn the other hand, some examples of inline dinosaurs are the (a)nklyosaurus and the (strong)asaurus. <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"40%\"><br><br>\nInline dinosaurs are more considerate: they only take up as much space as they need. You cannot force them to change their width and height, and you can\'t add padding to their top and bottom (only to their sides). These dinosaurs don\'t mind sharing line space and sitting next to other dinosaurs. When next to other dinosaurs, they listen to whitespace, and so will leave a bit of room between them when asked to do so.<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"30%\"> <img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"30%\"> <img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"30%\"><br><br>\n<strong>Mixing and Matching</strong><br>\nYou can change the personality of block dinosaurs to be inline, or the personality of inline dinosaurs to be block, but there may be some cases where you want to mix and match the properties of both, e.g. having two (div)lodocuses sit next to each other, but still being able to change their width and height. In such a case, there are two main solutions: floating your dinosaurs or changing them to inline-block dinosaurs.<br>\nFloating your dinosaurs will enable them to sit next to each other, whilst maintaining their other helpful block properties: <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"10%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"60%\"><br><br>\nHowever, this takes them out of the document flow, so any parent dinosaurs will be unable to see floated child dinosaurs:<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/docflow.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"70%\"><br><br>\nTo fix this, we can give the parent dinosaur the property \"overflow: auto;\", letting it know where the children have gone. <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/docflow2.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"70%\"><br><br>\nAn alternative to floating is changing the necessary dinosaurs to \"display: inline-block\", giving them the best parts of both block and inline dinosaurs. However, inline-block dinosaurs still listen to whitespace, like their inline counterparts, so there will be spaces between them: <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\">   <img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"> <img src=\"images/dinos/dactyl.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"><br><br>\nTo enable these dinosaurs to get close to one another, you can change their parent\'s font-size to 0 and their own font-size to the required amount:<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/contentdip.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"40%\"><br><br>\nBy using these methods, you will have ultimate control over any dinosaur\'s style and placement: <br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/ank.png\" alt=\"anklyosaurus\" width=\"30%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/diplo.png\" alt=\"diplodocus\" width=\"30%\"><img src=\"images/dinos/dactyl.png\" alt=\"pterodactyl\" width=\"40%\"><br><br>\nAnd then, there\'s the clearfix...but we\'ll save that one for another time!<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/dinos/rex.png\" alt=\"t-rex\" width=\"95%\"><br><br>\nPlease also check out the <a href=\"http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/jess-and-aimee-on-learning-html-and-css/\"><i>original version</i></a> of this blog on the <a href=\"http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk\"><i>Mayden Academy website.</i></a>','So, let\'s talk about HTML, CSS and dinosaurs.

	(2,'The Point of No Return','halfway-blog','It\'s the end of week 7, so next week will officially be our halfway point at Mayden Academy. I can\'t believe how quickly the weeks have been passing, how much we\'ve managed to learn during these seven short weeks and, perhaps most importantly, how much I\'m enjoying it! <br><br>\n\nI\'ve never had a job before where I didn\'t have to force myself out of bed in the morning and feel that sense of impending doom with every footstep I took before entering the workplace. From what I\'ve experienced over these last 7 weeks, the world of software development feels completely different. As a learning environment, I don\'t doubt that our time at the Academy is a far cry from the actual day to day of being a developer, but I love the problem solving, the teamwork, the creativity, the continual learning of new things, the feeling that I\'m using my brain all day long, the frustration when something isn\'t working and the satisfaction when it starts to work. Not being the greatest morning person, I do still have to force myself out of bed, but as soon as my feet touch the floor I\'m excited about what we\'re going to be doing that day, and I hope this is something that will stay with me throughout the rest of my career. <br><br>\n\nI\'ve mainly been focusing on typing up my notes after work, preparing our bi-weekly challenges, revising for our tests and practising what we\'ve learned, but now that we\'re halfway through (and especially now that we\'ve been over the entire LAMP stack) I want to start working on my own projects. Number 1 is going to be creating an art portfolio site for myself so that I can put up work I\'ve done for bands (creating album art) and have a central page for it all. We also start Javascript next week so if I get started on the basics asap, I might then be able to start making my pages look more interesting with animations and effects. I was also thinking of how I could make some sort of text-based game, perhaps by storing particular responses in a database and generating the responses based on user-input by using an html form, but that\'s a little more complicated and an art site is a good way to use everything that we\'ve learned so far, HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL (I\'m thinking about storing the image paths in a database and pulling everything through that way.) <br><br>\n\nI\'ve found a few sites that I like the look of to get some ideas from and have wireframed out a layout, so the next part is doing some painting (I want to include some art on the front page - I\'m thinking a painted image of my own that has no background so that it looks like it\'s static but actually scrolls on top of the page background...I\'ll see how it turns out anyway!) so that\'s exciting for me too as with all of my preparation and after-hours work for the academy I haven\'t been able to do much art recently. <br><br>\n\nI\'m also going to try and write a blog every so often (this one seems to be going okay as the first one!) so I thought a good way to do that would be to write about my home projects...that\'s it for now anyway. Over and out! <br><br>\n\np.s. I went to PHP SouthWest this week and it was great - can\'t say I completely understood the two talks but definitely understood the gist of them and, having only spent one day on OOP so far, it was really useful to see some examples of it in practice. Looking forward to the next one (including the generously provided PHPizza!)','It\'s the end of week 7, so next week will officially be our halfway point at Mayden Academy...

	(3,'Wizards','wizards-blog','In medieval chivalric romance, the wizard often appears as a wise old man and acts as a mentor, with Merlin from the King Arthur stories being a prime example. Wizards such as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and Albus Dumbledore from the Harry Potter books are also featured as mentors, and Merlin remains prominent as both an educative force and mentor in modern works of Arthuriana. Other magicians, such as Saruman, from The Lord of the Rings series, can appear as hostile villains. Villainous sorcerers were so crucial to pulp fantasy that the genre in which they appeared was dubbed sword and sorcery.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\'s A Wizard of Earthsea explored the question of how wizards learned their art, introducing to modern fantasy the role of the wizard as protagonist. This theme has been further developed in modern fantasy, often leading to wizards as heroes on their own quests. Such heroes may have their own mentor, a wizard as well.\n\nWizards can be cast similarly to the absent-minded professor: being foolish and prone to misconjuring. They can also be capable of great magic, both good or evil. Even comical wizards are often capable of great feats, such as those of Miracle Max in The Princess Bride; although he is a washed-up wizard fired by the villain, he saves the dying hero.\n\nMagicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called grimoires, which may have magical properties of their own.Sorcerers in Conan the Barbarian often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in Poul Anderson\'s A Midsummer Tempest, Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician Prospero to learn magic. The same occurs in the Dungeons and Dragons-based novel series Dragonlance Chronicles, wherein Raistlin Majere seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus.\n\nSome magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects. For example, Dr. Strange from the Marvel Universe continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven\'t been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, Dr. Doom continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. Fred and George Weasley from Harry Potter invent new magical items and use them as pranks (and, later, sell them as legitimate defense items).','In medieval chivalric romance, the wizard often appears as a wise old man and acts as a mentor, with Merlin from the King...

	(4,'Time Travel','time-travel-blog','Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or Einstein?Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a proven phenomenon in relativistic physics, but traveling any significant \"distance\" requires motion at speeds close to the speed of light, which is not feasible for human travel with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells\' 1895 novel The Time Machine, which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\n\nSome ancient myths depict skipping forward in time. In Hindu mythology, the Mahabharata mentions the story of King Raivata Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is shocked to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed. The Buddhist Pli Canon mentions the relativity of time. The Payasi Sutta tells of one of the Buddha\'s chief disciples, Kumara Kassapa, who explains to the skeptic Payasi that, \"In the Heaven of the Thirty Three Devas, time passes at a different pace, and people live much longer. \"In the period of our century; one hundred years, only a single day; twenty four hours would have passed for them.\" The Japanese tale of \"Urashima Tar?\", first described in the Nihongi tells of a young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace. After three days, he returns home to his village and finds himself 300 years in the future, where he has been forgotten, his house is in ruins, and his family has died.\n\nEarly science-fiction stories feature characters who sleep for years and awaken in a changed society. Among them L\'An 2440, rêve s\'il en fût jamais (1770) by Louis-Sébastien Mercier, Rip Van Winkle (1819) by Washington Irving, Looking Backward (1888) by Edward Bellamy, and When the Sleeper Awakes (1899) by H.G. Wells. Prolonged sleep, like the more familiar time machine, is used as a means of time travel in these stories. Decades-long and centuries-long sleep is featured in many ancient myths.\n\nSome theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible. In technical papers, physicists generally avoid the commonplace language of \"moving\" or \"traveling\" through time. \"Movement\" normally refers only to a change in spatial position as the time coordinate is varied. Instead they discuss the possibility of closed timelike curves, which are world lines that form closed loops in spacetime, allowing objects to return to their own past. There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as Gödel spacetime, but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.\n\nRelativity predicts that if one were to move away from the Earth at relativistic velocities and return, more time would have passed on Earth than for the traveler, so in this sense it is accepted that relativity allows \"travel into the future.\" According to relativity there is no single objective answer to how much time has really passed between the departure and the return, but there is an objective answer to how much proper time has been experienced by both the Earth and the traveler, i.e., how much each has aged (see twin paradox). On the other hand, many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely. Any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of causality. The classic example of a problem involving causality is the \"grandfather paradox\": what if one were to go back in time and kill one\'s own grandfather before one\'s father was conceived? But some scientists believe that paradoxes can be avoided, by appealing either to the Novikov self-consistency principle or to the notion of branching parallel universes, such as in the Everett?Wheeler many-worlds interpretation.','Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement...

	(5,'Pineapples','pineapple-blog','The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries, also called pineapples, and the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family. Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in 20/24 months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapples do not ripen significantly post-harvest.\n\nPineapples can be consumed fresh, cooked, juiced, or preserved. They are found in a wide array of cuisines. In addition to consumption, the pineapple leaves are used to produce the textile fiber piña in the Philippines, commonly used as the material for the men\'s Barong Tagalog and women\'s Baro\'t saya formal wear in the country. The fiber is also used as a component for wallpaper and other furnishings.\n\nThe word \"pineapple\" in English was first recorded to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones). When European explorers discovered this tropical fruit in the Americas, they called them \"pineapples\" (first referenced in 1664 for resemblance to the pine cone).\n\nIn the scientific binomial Ananas comosus, ananas, the original name of the fruit, comes from the Tupi word nanas, meaning \"excellent fruit\", as recorded by André Thevet in 1555, and comosus, tufted, refers to the stem of the fruit. Other members of the Ananas genus are often called pine, as well, in other languages. In Spanish, pineapples are called piña (\"pine cone\"), or ananá (ananás) (for example, the piña colada drink).','The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries, also called...

	(6,'Cheese','cheese-blog','Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\n\nHundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal\'s diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.\n\nFor a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.\n\nCheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening. Generally speaking, hard cheeses, such as parmesan last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat\'s milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable.\n\nThere is some debate as to the best way to store cheese, but some experts[who?] say that wrapping it in cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside, and the outside has a layer of wax. This specific combination of plastic on the inside and wax on the outside protects the cheese by allowing condensation on the cheese to be wicked away while preventing moisture from within the cheese escaping.\n\nA specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger. Becoming an expert in this field requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience, much like becoming an expert in wine or cuisine. The cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting the cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.','Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the...
