			<p>Hi! I'm Aim&eacute;e! I have recently moved to Bristol and am currently a student/trainee at <a href="http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/"><em>Mayden Academy</em></a>, an intense software development training programme based in Bath, and am very excited to be learning HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and Javascript in the hope of pursuing a career in software development. Prior to this, I lived in Cornwall, working in payroll and administration and performing proofreading/translation tasks online. Alongside my university study, I used to tutor languages and mathematics and also worked in a kitchen, making pizzas.</p>

			<p class="alternate">Since January 2016, I have been undertaking a part-time degree with the Open University in Computing and IT, due to my increasing fascination for computing and technology. In July 2013, I graduated from the University of Sussex with a First Class honours degree in English. Software development neatly combines my love of languages and computing and I feel very fortunate to have been able to study both subjects! Growing up in Cornwall, I studied A Levels from 2007 - 2009 at Truro College and GCSE's from 2002 - 2007 at Penair School.</p>

			<p>I have been playing piano for ten years and enjoy composing my own <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/aimsbert"><em>music</em></a>. As an avid reader and writer, I hope one day to finish writing a novel, but so far have written some short stories, a graphic novella and other bits and pieces. Drawing/painting are likewise hobbies of mine, and I create album artwork for bands in my spare time. </p>
